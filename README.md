Nami's Minions

**Project Description:**
We are planning to build a web application that delivers song recommendations and generates playlists for moods using LLMs. This will be based on a backend that stores hundreds of thousands of songs, as well as their features like valence, danceability, etc. We plan to deliver song recommendations using content-based or collaborative filtering. We also are looking to use LLMs to provide more context-aware recommendations. For example, if a user says they want "slow Jazz music," then we might want to use LLMs to extract keywords and create structured queries.
